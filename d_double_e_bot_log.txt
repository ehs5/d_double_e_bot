> I don't think you've actually listened to a lot of the Grime tracks/sets from 2001-2006/7ish, then you'll see how differentiated it is to the later music.

I would hope a genre would sound different in a 15 year time span. It would be way more problematic if it still sounded the same.

Also, thanks for the condesending tone. It's not like I've never linked to any "golden era" set on this sub or never posted anything about tunes from that era or something. I'll even outdo you on listening to "OG" UK music, since we're playing that game. [Wiley and D Double E Jungle/DnB set from '98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlWAzZfEaYo).

Also also, the "you just don't understand" attitude doesn't exactly help disprove the grandpa good old days attitude if you were trying that.

> But the Golden Grime era needs to have a proper documentary about it on Netflix, like Hip Hop has its own, so it's not forgotten and for anyone else to learn about it, from the roots to UK Garage and Jungle, pirate radio sets, raves*, beef, ghetto life, Channel U etc.

Yeah, a true shame that something like that doesn't exist ... [oh wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVAllUgXyto&list=PLlCEg4hCa1LHLLYk4KQQIGPMhXFy2FMXY). To be fair, I don't think it includes grime or Channel U, but everything else is covered very nicely.

Btw, why does it need to be on Netflix? Don't search for validation where you don't want it.

> UK Garage only was around 1997-2002ish I think, which was short lived aswell. Same with all the UK rave genres only last around 5 years, same with Bassline and then House Music.

Lol, I'll go tell all the DnB fans that their genre died in '01.

Also, thinking all UK rave genres only last 5 years really makes you look like a musical opportunist. It makes you look like how grime fans look at the "J Hus is my favorite MC" crowd.

I’m also Canadian and I’ve been into grime since around 2002. Are you looking for what’s happening in the scene now, or legendary releases from back in the day?

A few names to get you started: Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Kano, D Double E, Roll Deep Crew, Skepta, Stormzy, JME, Chip, P Money, Devlin, Ghetts, Ruff Sqwad, Terror Danjah, Giggs, Novelist, etc.

I can recommend specific albums or tracks if you want too.

Dizzee, JME, Ghetts, Skepta, old AJ Tracey we’re all my jam a few years back.

I still like it all but don’t listen to it anywhere near as much as I used to.

I really enjoyed the album Jammer put out late last year(?). The song Built This City with D Double E and Wiley is brilliant. “Step my air forces, no my n***** won’t DigDat” Love that bar hahaha.

The Norf Face album with the BBK boys on it is a good recent project as well!

Yeah can’t lie this one reigns truest, ghetts would be my choice but he wasn’t my favourite back in the day but has progressed to a point where I class his as a great in this but D Double E has literally kept the same format and still shells.. timeless

I used to enjoy Big H a lot back in the day, I would describe his flow like nursery ryhme grime, definetly was my personal favourite. Prez T legend. D Double E legend. Scruffizer underrated. Dot Rotten, P Money, Flirta D, Devilman list goes on.
